// Build a component that displays a hierarchical structure of checkboxes. The component should handle parent-child relationships between checkboxes and manage their states efficiently.

// Requirements
// A checkbox's value is determined by the value of its direct children:
// When all children of a parent are checked, the parent should be checked.
// When some (but not all or none) children of a parent are checked, the parent should be in an indeterminate state, with a dash displayed within the box.
// When none of the children of a parent are checked, the parent is unchecked.
// If a parent checkbox is checked or unchecked, all the descendant checkboxes (not just direct children) will be updated with that new value.
// The focus of the exercise is on the functionality and not the styling. You may style the checkboxes in any way you prefer as long as the states are clear.

// Data format
interface CheckboxItem {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  checked: boolean | "indeterminate";
  children?: CheckboxItem[];
